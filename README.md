# RUA
Rua - the Simple Monograph Workflow

# Context
Rua is an Open Source application designed to assist with the Monograph publishing life cycle. Stages include:

- optional proposal
- submission
- internal review
- peer review
- copy editing
- production
- publication

# Technology
RUA is written in Python using the Django Web Application framework and follows a MTV (that is, “model”, “template”, and “view.”) style. The template system is simple, easy to modify and uses Twitter Bootstrap 3.

# Development
If you want to hack on RUA, getting it set up is easy. You'll need a unix machine (you can set it up on Windows if you're super hard core). We recommend you use [VirtualEnvironment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) with [VirtualEnvWrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Once these are installed, clone the repo with:

	$ git clone https://github.com/ubiquitypress/rua.git

Make a virtual environment:

	$ mkvirtualenv rua

And install the requirements (requirements.txt is found in the root folder of the repo):

	$ pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install a small number of requirements including Django. By default the program uses SQLite in development but for production it's recommended you make use of MySQL or Postgresql.

Sync and migrate the SQLite DB (from the src folder):

	$ python manage.py syncdb
	$ python manage.py migrate

We have a few required database settings so you need to import some data:

	$ python manage.py loaddata core/fixtures/settinggroup.json
	$ python manage.py loaddata core/fixtures/settings.json
	$ python manage.py loaddata core/fixtures/cc-licenses.json
	$ python manage.py loaddata core/fixtures/role.json

In the future this will all be hanlded by an install command.

To start hacking run (from the src folder):

	$ python manage.py runserver

You'll now be able to access the server from http://localhost:8000
